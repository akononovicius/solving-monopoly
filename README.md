# "Solving" Monopoly

Code in this repository attempts to "solve" (answer interesting questions)
about two simple roll and move games ("linear" and "looped") as well as
Monopoly. There are two different takes on Monopoly made available here:
simple (ignores speeding rule and complicated jail mechanics) and
complicated (takes into account speeding and jail mechanics). Both takes on
Monopoly assume that "Chance" and "Community chest" cards are reshuffled
after each draw (otherwise state-space gets a lot more complicated).

Most of the code was written on-camera. Cropped and truncated recording of
the lecture is available as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6145wsWtScM&list=PLbnvhMGJ97x3MOTvKxWtSJUeC7Darp3Om&index=1](Youtube playlist).
